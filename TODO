Testing:
	- ensure that saving r4-r7 in a stacked register properly preserves
	  the NaT bit, even in the face of register-rotation
	- ensure that IA64_INSN_MOVE_STACKED works correctly in the face of
	  register rotation
	- on Linux, test access to f32-f127 in a signal handler (e.g., verify
	  that fph partition gets initialized properly)

=== taken care of:

+ cache the value of *cfm_loc; each rotate_FOO() call needs it!
+ implement the remote-lookup of the dynamic registration list
+ when doing sigreturn, must restore fp regs (and perhaps other regs) the same
  way as the (user-level) gate.S sigreturn path does!
+ unw_resume() must at least restore gp (r1)!  consider restoring all
  scratch regs (but what's the performance impact on exception handling?);
  alternative: restore scratch regs that may be used during procedure
  call/return (e.g., r8-r11, f8-f11)
+ implement unw_resume() for the case where the current register frame is split
  across multiple backing stores
+ document restricions on using unw_resume():
+ implement remote cases of unw_resume()
+ test both with UNW_LOCAL_ONLY and without where this makes sense
+ allow region-length (insn_count) in unw_dyn_region_info_t to be negative
  to indicate counting from the end of the procedure (to make it possible
  for differently-sized procedures to share the same region list if they
  share the same prologue/epilogue).
+ it appears that it is currently not possible to read register UNW_IA64_TP;
  fix that => no, attempts to access r13 will result in access_reg() callbacks,
  as desired; for local-case, access to r13 will fail though (since
  getcontext() doesn't, and shouldn't, capture r13)
+ document the special nature of UNW_IA64_GP: read-only, but adjusted
  automatically if the IP is changed
+ use pthread-mutexes where necessary, atomic ops where possible
