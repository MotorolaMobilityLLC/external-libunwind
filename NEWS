** Added two new routines to the API:
	- unw_is_fpreg()
	- unw_get_save_loc()
** Added multi-architecture supports (lets a single application use
   the unwind libraries for multiple target architectures; this is useful,
   e.g., useful for building a debugger that can support multiple targets
   such as ia32, ia64, etc.)
